StarEngine: 2D Game Engine
==========

_Note:_ Their will be a compact website soon containing all the info below along with an embedding guide, downloads, tutorials and all the other resources you need to get started with the StarEngine.

StarEngine is a Game Engine to develop 2D Games fast and easy. It is written in C++11, but also allows you to write your games in C and ChaiScript. The goal is to allow very fast development, which is often needed in prototyping. Thanks to the many embedded opensource libraries we can provide you with all the features you might need. Keep in mind that we aim for a miniamlistic and compact game engine.

You can find more information at [our wiki](https://github.com/StarEngine/engine/wiki).

The current version number and patch notes for this patch and the previous versions can be found [here](https://github.com/StarEngine/engine/wiki/Patchnotes).

## Examples

_The engine is still in the alpha base, come back later when the engine reaches a beta stage. At that point we'll have several example applications and a big interactive tutorial to help you getting started!_

## Further Documentation

The documentation of our engine is generated via [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). You can download the latest documentation our the StarEngine [here](#todo) (_comming soon_). You can also read our documentation in the header files of the engine code that allows you to write your game once, and deploy it on several desktop and mobile platforms.

## Project Organization

This project is the successor of an engine made as a University project. The main developers and maintainers of the StarEngine are Cedric Van de Walle, Glen De Cauwsemaecker and Pieter Vantorre.

We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions, which you can post as an issue, next to the bug reports. Please read [our contribution guide](https://github.com/StarEngine/engine/wiki/contributor-guide) in case you would like to help in the development or file bugs.

## Continuous Integration status

This project is tested with [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/). [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/StarEngine/engine.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/StarEngine/engine)
